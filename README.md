# Strange Flesh Source

Welcome the the Strange Flesh source code repository. Here you can view the full sourcecode of Strange Flesh, and see how we pulled off making a complete, polished game that runs right in a web browser. Everything you need to play the game is here... except images and sounds.

The GitHub community guidelines state:

>Donâ€™t post content that is pornographic. This does not mean that all nudity, or all code and content related to sexuality, is prohibited. We recognize that sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic sexual content may be a part of your project, or may be presented for educational or artistic purposes.

I don't think we can even try to claim that the sexuality in Strange Flesh qualifies as "part of life" or "non-pornographic". I am not going to insult the intelligence of GitHub's moderation staff. 

IF AND ONLY IF YOU ARE OVER 18 YEARS OF AGE, you may download the images and sounds of Strange Flesh from the following off-site link: [Get Strange Flesh Media Pack](http://greatestbear.com/strangeflesh/Strange-Flesh-Media-v1.4.zip)
_Note: This content is highy explicit_

If you would like to contribute to this project by making the game run better on mobile platforms, use less memory, or more easily translatable to other languages, I would love to collaborate. Talk to me. Make a pull request.
